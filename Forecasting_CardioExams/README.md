# Forecasting incoming cardiovascular examinations for Fargo Health Group

In this project, I aggregated data from 5 different health centers in Louisiana over 7 years and addressed data quality issues (redundant, inconsistent data entries and imputing missing values) and forecasted incoming cardiovascular examinations for the subsequent year using ARIMA and Holt-Winters modeling techniques for time series data. I also provided recommendations for Fargo Health Group to shore up data inconsistencies and highlighted ways to address volume of incoming cardiovascular examinations
