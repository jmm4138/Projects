# The History of the Home Run
In 2017, 6,105 home runs (HRs) were hit in Major League Baseball (MLB) – the most ever in history and a 46% increase since 2014. This inspired a thoughtful look at how the number of HRs per season has changed since the first major league baseball game in 1871 and exploration into the potential impactful factors, including the average player’s weight each season and steroid usage. 

This visualization shows two time series graphs covering the time span from 1871 to 2017 – one (in orange) highlighting the number of HRs hit each season and a second (in blue) showing the increase in average player weights. Various MLB milestones or key dates—like adding teams, changing the number of games and a period called the “steroid era”—are referenced, using vertical dashed lines, to show a comprehensive story of the HR increases over time and explore why this may be happening. In this visualization, you should clearly see as players get stronger (which I’ve equated with weight) they hit more home runs. There are other interesting insights like an increase in home runs and weight during the “steroid era” and a decline in home runs after the MLB started to test for Performance Enhancing Drugs (or PEDs). 

This specific dataset was provided by Sean Lahman, an award-winning journalist, on www.seanlahman.com. Sean creates historical databases covering a gamut of sports, including baseball, pro and college football, pro and college basketball, auto racing, tennis, boxing and the Olympic games. For this visualization, I merged two spreadsheets together called Batting.csv (which included HRs) and People.csv (which included weights). There were a handful of missing values for player weights but not enough to skew the results.
